## Qiskit Education

### Objective: Provide a solution guide based on Qiskit to help educators teach Quantum more easily and effectively

#### Goal:
1. Organize teaching material in a curriculum structure to make it easier for educators to build their own course syllabus.
2. Build "Educator's Qiskit," a stable instance of Qiskit for educators and students.
3. Provide guidelines for contributing (e.g., translation, tutorial content)

#### Approach:
1. Involve educators in the field for input and guidance
2. Ensure materials are in formats that are interactive and can be hosted in an executable environment. (e.g., Jupyter Book, Binder)
3. Provide tools that will make it easier for students to visualize concepts without deep knowledge in the computing language (e.g., VPython)
