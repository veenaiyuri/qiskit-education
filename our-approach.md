# The problem

Qiskit is an excellent educational tool. In addition to the built-in simulators that allow students to test quantum
computation, they can upload their requests to a real IBM quantum computer and obtain some intution about the
performance of their computations in a real system.

Following the discussions with representatives from Harvard, Yale and NYU, one of the key lessons that we learned was
that various version changes in Qiskit result in old notebooks breaking, such that course material which worked in the
past no longer works at present. 

# The solution
Motivated by this, and also inspired to make life easier for educators using Qiskit, we are creating a wrapper around
Qiskit that makes programming simpler for first-time users.

Hooray2!
