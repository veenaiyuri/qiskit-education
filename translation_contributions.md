# Contributing translations to Qiskit

First, thank you! Translating these materials can help you learn the concepts at a new level while also making the project more accessible and available to everyone.

## Current translation efforts

As of September 2019, we have updated our localization guidelines in the [Contributint to Qiskit](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit/blob/master/docs/contributing_to_qiskit.rst#contributing-to-qiskit) section in the official Qiskit github repo.
